When using real-time model serving with Databricks, you can use **offline** tables *without* utilizing feature lookups or **online** tables *with* feature lookups (in which case Databricks provides automatic feature lookup). To utilize **offline** tables with feature lookups, there is batch inferencing via the `score_batch` method from the Databricks SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Fundamentally**, a **feature table** is a **materialized Delta table with a primary key** that we want to use for model training. Feature lookups must be configured prior to training your model. For further reading and references of offline vs online feature tables, see the Appendix at the end of this demo.\n",

    "### More on Offline and Online Tables with Real-Time Model Serving\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Offline\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use an existing Delta table in Unity Catalog that includes a primary key constraint as a feature table. If the table does not have a primary key defined, you must update the table using ALTER TABLE DDL statements to add the constraint. See *Use an existing Delta table in Unity Catalog as a feature table*.\n",
    "- Any streaming table or materialized view in Unity Catalog with a primary key can be a feature table in Unity Catalog, and you can use the Features UI and API with the table.\n",
    "- You can update a feature table in Unity Catalog by adding new features or by modifying specific rows based on the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Reading**: [Working with feature tables in UC](https://www.databricks.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Online\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a scoring request comes in to the model, Model Serving automatically retrieves the published feature values needed by the model. In this way, the most recent feature values are always used for predictions.\n",
    "- You can create a Python UDF in a notebook or in Databricks SQL.\n",
    "- When a Python UDF depends on the result of a FeatureLookup, the value returned if the requested lookup key is not found depends on the environment. When using score_batch, the value returned is None. When using online serving, the value returned is float(\"nan\").\n",
    "- Models packaged with feature metadata can be registered to Unity Catalog. The feature tables used to create the model must be stored in Unity Catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Reading**: [Use features in online workflows](https://www.databricks.com/), [Compute features on demand](https://www.databricks.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Serving – [Feature Serving Endpoints](https://www.databricks.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use Mosaic AI Model Serving to serve a model that was built using features from Databricks, the model automatically looks up and transforms features for inference requests. With Databricks Feature Serving, you can serve structured data for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications, as well as features that are required for other applications, such as models served outside of Databricks or any other application that requires features based on data in Unity Catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Databricks Feature Serving provides a single interface that serves pre-materialized and on-demand features. It also includes the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Databricks handles the infrastructure. With a single API call, Databricks creates a production-ready serving environment.\n",
    "- **High availability and scalability**: Feature Serving endpoints automatically scale up and down to adjust to the volume of serving requests.\n",
    "- **Security**: Endpoints are deployed in a secure network boundary and use dedicated compute that terminates when the endpoint is deleted or scaled to zero.\n",
